# ðŸ˜ˆ Offense Intended
Chrome extension that insults (and educates) you.

Every time you open up a new tab in Chrome, we greet you with a unique, vocabulary-rich insult. Don't know what it means? We expected that much. Hover over the vocabulary words to view their definition. Offended? Press the space bar for a new insult, or open another tab.

We were too much of a `disreputable nincompoop` to bother putting this in the Chrome store, so here's how to get this extension for yourself:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. (Node version must be >= 14.)
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Load your extension on Chrome following:
     1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
     2. Turn on Developer mode
     3. Select "Load unpacked" option
     4. Select the `build` folder of this repo.
5. Get offended!
