# ðŸ˜ˆ Offense Intended
Chrome extension that insults (and educates) you.

Every time you open up a new tab in Chrome, we greet you with a unique, vocabulary-rich insult. Don't know what it means? We expected that much. Hover over the vocabulary words to view their definition. Offended? Press the space bar for a new insult, or open another tab.
